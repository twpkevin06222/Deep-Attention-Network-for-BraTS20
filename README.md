# Deep Supervised Attention Networks for Pixel-wise Brain Tumour Segmentation 

## Dataset 
The aim of the project was to solve the Multimodal Brain Tumour Segmentation Challenge 2020 ([BraTS20](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html)). Training and validatin dataset can be obtain upon request at the official website (subjected to registration). The each patients MRI images containts multimodal of Flair, T1, T1CE, T2 and a ground truth annotation of brain tumor pixel. The brain tumour contains sub regions, where Peritumoural Edema(red), Necrotic and Non-enhancing tumour Core(blue), Necrotic and
GD-Enhancing tumour(green) and Background(black).
